# data-movies

Simple java project to get list of movies from [IMDB Api](https://imdb-api.com/API).

This project get all 250 top movies.

How to use?

Step 1: Download this project

Step 2: Create a file with name "properties.txt" and put a string with key created on [IMDB Api](https://imdb-api.com/API) on this format: "api_key:your-key", because the application use this for Http Request on Imdb Api.

Step 3: Execute on your IDE or compile yourself and use on command line.

The expected output is a string like this:

```
Data Movies
{"items":[{"id":"tt0111161","rank":"1","title":"The Shawshank Redemption" .....
```

I used only Java Code.
